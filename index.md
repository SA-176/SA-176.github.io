## Hello World!

This is my ePortfolio that showcases my knowledge and skills I've gained through the Computer Science program of Southern New Hamphsire University. Thoughout the program I was able to learn many new skills and languages that I can take with me into my future career in computer science development. 


## Code Review

First is my code review. In this video I reviewed each of my chosen artifacts before enhancing.

## First Artifact

My first artifact that I enhanced was my program from my CS 300 course. It was a .csv loader program that was written in C++. For my enhancement I rewrote the program using Python instead to showcase my ability to skill in design and software engineering by designing the program to work using python script instead of C++ script and enhancing the array storage method. I ended up throwing out the vector useage from the original C++ program and relying on the better array methods present in Python to simplify the code.

## Second Artifact

My 2nd artifact is my project from my CS 405 class. In this project I had to program a series of unit tests using the Gunit testing environment to run code test on different array changes. For my enhancement I added a series of new tests to showcase my understanding of code structure and algorithms. I added tests to ensure data was hashed after using hasher. I ran a test to verify a quadratic equation and a trigonometric equation. there was also an added test to file loading to ensure the file it was loaded to read the correct data and a test in the same test function to ensure the file was closed by the end of the function. then there were two Test_P classes to test two tests each. and to ensure the data being sent through GET_PARAM is being squared and cubed correctly and the other had a ASSERT_TRUE and an ASSERT_FALSE test attached to it. one to ensure the math came back true and the other to make sure the math in the function failed.
