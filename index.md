## Hello World!

This is my ePortfolio that showcases my knowledge and skills I've gained through the Computer Science program of Southern New Hamphsire University. Thoughout the program I was able to learn many new skills and languages that I can take with me into my future career in computer science development. 


## Code Review

First is my code review. In this video I reviewed each of my chosen artifacts before enhancing. In the review I breakdown the design of each project, detailing what each function. I go through the code structure and algorithms.

## First Artifact

My first artifact that I enhanced was my program from my CS 300 course. It was a .csv loader program that was written in C++. It loaded a menu for the user for a course planner that included four options. First option is to load from a file the course information. This information is stored for each class by name, number and prerequisite courses. then there are the options for coirse viewing. One that prints the full course list organized by course number. the second option loads an individual course the user inputs the number for. It prints the course name, number and then lists the prerequisite courses. then there is the final exit option that exits the course planner application. For my enhancement I rewrote the program using Python instead to showcase my ability to skill in design and software engineering by designing the program to work using python script instead of C++ script and enhancing the array storage method. I ended up throwing out the vector useage from the original C++ program and relying on the better array methods present in Python to simplify the code.

## Second Artifact

My 2nd artifact is my project from my CS 405 class. In this project I had to program a series of unit tests using the Gunit testing environment to run code test on different array changes. For my enhancement I added a series of new tests to showcase my understanding of code structure and algorithms. I added tests to ensure data was hashed after using hasher. I ran a test to verify a quadratic equation and a trigonometric equation. there was also an added test to file loading to ensure the file it was loaded to read the correct data and a test in the same test function to ensure the file was closed by the end of the function. then there were two Test_P classes to test two tests each. and to ensure the data being sent through GET_PARAM is being squared and cubed correctly and the other had a ASSERT_TRUE and an ASSERT_FALSE test attached to it. one to ensure the math came back true and the other to make sure the math in the function failed.
