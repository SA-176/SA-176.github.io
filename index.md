## Welcome

This is my ePortfolio that showcases my knowledge and skills I've gained through the Computer Science program of Southern New Hamphsire University. Thoughout the program I was able to learn many new skills and languages that I can take with me into my future career in computer science development. 


## code review

First is my code review. In this video I reviewed each of my chosen artifacts before enhancing.

## First Artifact

My first artifact that I enhanced was my program from my CS 300 course. It was a .csv loader program that was written in C++. For my enhancement I rewrote the program using Python instead to showcase my ability to skill in design and software engineering by designing the program to work using python script instead of C++ script and enhancing the array storage method. I ended up throwing out the vector useage from the original C++ program and relying on the better array methods present in Python to simplify the code.
